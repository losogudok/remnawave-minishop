/**
 * A screen that is fetched the first time the customer opens it.
 *
 * The mini app boots into home and most sessions never leave it, so the code
 * behind the other tabs — the rich text editor on support most of all — has no
 * business being in the first payload. Each screen keeps its own chunk, is
 * imported on demand, and stays loaded afterwards, so switching back is
 * instant.
 *
 * The component type is inferred from the loader, so a screen rendered this way
 * type-checks its props exactly as a statically imported one does.
