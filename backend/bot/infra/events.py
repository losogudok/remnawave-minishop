"""In-process domain event bus.

The core publishes events at key points of the business flow; plugins (or
core modules) subscribe to react without the call sites knowing about them.
Typical subscribers register inside ``Plugin.setup``.

Design rules:

- ``emit`` never raises and never blocks the main flow beyond awaiting the
  subscribers sequentially; a failing subscriber is logged and skipped.
- Payloads are flat dicts of primitives (ids, numbers, strings, ISO-8601
  datetimes) - never ORM objects. Subscribers that need richer data re-read
  it from the database by id.
- Payment purchase units are normalized in :mod:`bot.infra.payment_events`.
  Plugins that introduce new payment-backed units can register purchase
  resolvers there while still subscribing to the plain event payload here.
- Events may be emitted shortly before the surrounding transaction commits;
  treat a payload as a notification, not as a guarantee the row is visible.

Event payload contracts live in :mod:`bot.infra.event_payloads`. Emit sites
construct those models first and publish their ``to_payload()`` dicts here;
third-party subscribers still receive the public ``(event_name, dict)``
signature.
