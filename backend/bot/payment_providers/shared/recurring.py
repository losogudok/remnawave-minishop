"""Cross-provider recurring (auto-renew) building blocks.

Auto-renew used to be hard-wired to YooKassa. This module defines the small,
provider-agnostic contract the renewal worker speaks to, so any provider that
can charge a previously saved payment method (a YooKassa ``payment_method_id``,
a CloudPayments ``Token``, etc.) participates through the same code path.

A provider service opts in by implementing two members:

* ``recurring_active`` - a property that is truthy when the provider is
  configured *and* recurring charges are switched on for it.
* ``charge_saved_payment_method(context)`` - an async method that initiates a
  charge against the saved method and returns a :class:`RecurringChargeResult`.

The renewal worker discovers such services through
``SubscriptionService.recurring_service_for(provider)`` (wired in
``build_core_services``) and never imports a concrete provider.
