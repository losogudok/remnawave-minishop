"""Background delivery of admin broadcasts over email.

The admin webapp broadcast endpoint queues Telegram messages through the rate
limited queue manager; email delivery is much slower (SMTP round-trips), so it
runs here as a detached asyncio task with bounded concurrency. Results are
summarized into ``message_logs`` so admins can audit delivery afterwards.
